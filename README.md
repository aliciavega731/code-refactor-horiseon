# HTML CSS Git Challenge: Code Refactor

Horiseon is a website that helps businesses and other individuals to improve SEO, online reputation management and social media marketing methods. 

The purpose of this first challenge is to make adjustments and clean up the code that we were given. There were IDs missing for proper linking, ALT text for images in the website and a proper name for the website.
